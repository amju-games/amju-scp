US 8 Ball Pool Rules
***
To win this game you must legally pot the 8 ball.
At first you may hit and pot any ball except the 8 ball.
Once a ball is potted, colours are decided. One player is 'spots', 
the other 'stripes'.
Once decided, you must always hit your colour with the cue ball first.
In this version it's ok to pot a spot or a stripe.
When all your colours have been potted, go for the 8 ball!
If you pot the cue ball, or hit a ball off the table, that's a foul.
If you pot the 8 ball on a foul you lose the game!
