6 Ball Pool Rules
***
To win this game you must legally pot the 6 ball.
The cue ball must first hit the lowest numbered ball each shot.
It's ok to pot a ball out of order as long as you hit the 
lowest numbered ball first.
If you pot the cue ball, or hit a ball off the table, you foul.
If you pot the 6 ball on a foul shot you lose the game!
