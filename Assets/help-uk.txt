UK Pool Rules
***
To win this game you must legally pot the 8 (black) ball.
At first you may hit and pot any ball except the 8 ball.
Once a ball is potted, colours are decided. Once decided, 
you must always hit your colour with the cue ball first.
Pot all your coloured balls, then pot the 8 ball to win.
If you pot the cue ball or hit a ball off the table, that's a foul.
If you pot the 8 ball on a foul you lose the game!
After a foul, the other player gets a free shot. This means the player 
can hit and pot either colour - but not the 8 ball.
