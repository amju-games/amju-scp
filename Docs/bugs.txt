Critical
========

Wii release: needs meta.xml and logo

//**Balls in pockets not recognised**
//- Almost certainly, it's because we are using .obj and there is no "solidity" flag, so pockets can't
// have visible but non-collidable faces
// - Add proprietary line to mtl file: flags, so space for more without changing file format again. 
// - table10.obj should be visible but not solid.

// Collisions etc broken. Trying to find the reveision that broke it.
// It was Orientation.cpp, bad conversion from rad to deg, r40

//Crash on exit - Engine is created before EventPoller, then Engine dtor accesses EventPoller after 
//it has been destroyed. Could use loki idea of Phoenix Singleton.

// Options/pause menu crash -- was null sound player 

//Wii hang on startup
// - If we use Console, it seems to be working fine! But nothing displayed when AmjuGLGCube is used. No response to buttons, maybe is hanging when initialising AmjuGL ? 
// - Log file ? Call Assert ?? or call exit() 
// Solved: was calling Viewport (in CreateWindow) before Init().... now has an assert which will prevent this

//Wii doesn't respond to buttons, so you can't do anything!
//Wii needs to show cursor -- move CursorManager to amjulib?

//Wii: Saving player data to wrong dir -- fix Directory 

Wii and iphone: can't enter player name!!!
-> Could have GUI keyboard but maybe just have player 1, player 2 and no stats....?

//iphone crashes on startup. Could be humungous mem usage ?
//Any way of remotely debugging without creating xcode project ?
//Poss to run in simulator, maybe by changing compiler flags ??
//"console" iphone build so we can run from cmd line on device
// -- was bad directory

iphone: bad viewport

iphone: must ask device for screen size

iphone: UI: Use only "left mouse button"
 - critical as iphone users only have one 'mouse button'

Cue pos (english, top spin, etc) uses picking and reads from back buffer!
Place ball
Birds eye view - get rid of this except to place ball ? Or, you can't take a shot in b/eye mode

Wii: use title-safe area 

//wii glue file is missing something, and wii build does complain about a missing file
//...but it seems to work ok!


Efficiency
==========

iphone + wii: make sure no _DEBUG, -O2, etc. 

iphone - strip dead code - set compiler flag

iphone bad framerate -- too many polys

//make sure binary obj format has numbers of verts, tris, etc. So we can reserve vector sizes up front.
// Yes it does!

Fix "Polygons"...
 - all on heap! -- done, 
 - vector of SceneVertex! - done, array of 3 now
 - bogus "absolute" coords should be removed

GetNumberOfPolygons() -- probably this is being called for a really crappy reason.
Don't care about nuber of scene polys - or can count in AmjuGL.

Pngs were upside-down. Either textures are being flipped somewhere or UVs (v coord) are being flipped ??
Flipped img, prob doing that twice for some (all) imgs ?!?
TODO Fix MD2 v-coord - md2 images are upside down but v-coord is flipped!?!?!?!!

//** WTF, Leaf files are 12MB!!!!!! **
//Del unused -- use GlueFile report, what happened to that ? Maybe compiled out.
//Urgently use Obj instead

// More efficient drawing - now using .obj
//Use binary obj format

Memory use
 - Will prob  need to load levels on demand..?? OK on Wii apparently, although start up delay is an issue

Wii: no VFC!!! When it was on, bits of scene and balls disappeared - I'm guessing projection matrix.

//Remove unused crap from Assets
//Convert leaf to obj, or at least .leafb.  -- DONE! But still loose ends as a result
Convert amju2 to amju2b ??
iphone reduced size textures

iphone + wii mipmapping ???


Cosmetic
========

No audio

Wii: Ball textures wrong, numbers missing!?! What up with the UVs ?
Wii: Can't play .it music

Wii: std::couts are visible!! These must *all* be #ifdef'd

Shadows, trees look wrong, because pngs now need to contain alpha channel. But may be simplest to just remove trees especially, and maybe table shadow..?

Attract mode can get stuck on 'crazy' version with block in the way. This also causes other probs so delete this type of room.

Trajectory billboards only face camera from one angle!

No lighting now!
Lighting is not the same as raw OpenGL, so some bits look too dark.

Some .leaf meshses had auto-gen UVs. The .objs have bogus UVs. Need to UV map them!

Some meshes are supposed to be sphere-mapped.

MD2 Model: for ASCP we should freeze at the end of non-looping anims
+ Marin height wrong (also Amju ?)

Localisation
 - Don't use hard coded text on images
 - Use Localise for all text



Bugs remaining from last release
================================

 - Amju skirt z fighting

 - Pause state crashes from menu or in-game
  ... because no sound player - there is prob something else going on too.

 - Foul message wrong if cue ball potted (player name changes when next player becomes active ?)

 - 8 ball: no explanatory message if you lose by potting the 8-ball too soon
