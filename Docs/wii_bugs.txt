Critical
========

Wii: missing snd files cause PAUSE
Try afconvert to make snd files ??
E.g. from iphone projects book:
afconvert -f caff -d LEI16 {IN} {OUT}
afconvert -f caff -d LEI16@22050 {IN} {OUT}

Wii: assert: EngineStatePoolSetUpShot.cpp:1317
Pressed B button when in place ball mode I think ?

Wii release: needs meta.xml 
and wiibrew page -- add some screenshots
make release -- script
download link
request add to Home brew browser
//and logo

Cue pos (english, top spin, etc) uses picking and reads from back buffer!
 - Use nunchuck stick

Birds eye view - get rid of this except to place ball ? Or, you can't take a shot in b/eye mode

Wii: use title-safe area 

Wii: displaying mouse diff info, causing jitter

Wii: no sound or music


Efficiency
==========

Check wii imgs are not flipped twice (or more.... urg)

Pngs were upside-down. Either textures are being flipped somewhere or UVs (v coord) are being flipped ??
Flipped img, prob doing that twice for some (all) imgs ?!?
TODO Fix MD2 v-coord - md2 images are upside down but v-coord is flipped!?!?!?!!


Wii: no VFC!!! When it was on, bits of scene and balls disappeared - I'm guessing projection matrix.

wii mipmapping ??? Also DX ?!
(reduced texture sizes for wii, iphone)

Audio
=====

Wii: check if music plays: No music!

Wii: convert wav to required format and check.


Cosmetic
========

hiscores.cfg message in loading screen

Wii/iphone buttons which don't make sense, e.g. change player name.
Options: full screen is not required. In fact could probably do without options menu at all.

Wii and iphone: can't enter player name!!!
-> Could have GUI keyboard but maybe just have player 1, player 2 and no stats....?

Wii: would be nice to have Controls page showing wiimote buttons

Wii: std::couts are visible!! These must *all* be #ifdef'd
Especially some x diff and y diff values printed every frame in EngineStatePoolSetUpShot..?

Wii Home button should pause, not quit
 - but probably best to have this as is for now
