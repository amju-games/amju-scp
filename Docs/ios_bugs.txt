Ella list
=========
SOmetimes the ball moves automatically
When the stick goes up the ball moves
Tell the people if you're player 1 or 2
Whose name is Marin?
Sometimes Marin or someone else has two goes without getting a ball in

Profiling
=========

BasicShadow: Update/Draw is slow


Critical
========

Movement Too sensitive

Don't take a shot if power is too low

Reinstate sky - but draw last in level ? 
and scenery

No show path - it KILLS framerate! -- try making dots much smaller before scrapping
 - it may be the calculation - is it done every frame?

Do release build. What to do for app store release?

iphone frame rate -- smaller ball meshes, smaller textures, no trees, etc.
 - PROFILE!
 - If necessary, do LOD on pool balls

Hearts flicker on Big Pockets screen, Trick shots 1 screen
 - iOS only??

Hearts count and status text at top of screen overlap. + sometimes text is hard to read. Give text a BG ?

Sound - not playing sound FX - because of limit on same sounds??

Cheri font: fix hearts and stars which are in lo res version - TEST

If you turn off music vol, you can't turn it on again, until the next song.


Efficiency
==========

Make bounding boxes around SolidLeaves, use for BVH. so we ignore more solids.

release: make sure no _DEBUG, -O2, etc. 

iphone - strip dead code - set compiler flag

iphone bad framerate -- too many polys ? Try non-debug


Pngs were upside-down. Either textures are being flipped somewhere or UVs (v coord) are being flipped ??
Flipped img, prob doing that twice for some (all) imgs ?!?
TODO Fix MD2 v-coord - md2 images are upside down but v-coord is flipped!?!?!?!!

Convert amju2 to amju2b ??

iphone reduced size textures? But using mipmapping


Audio
=====

Check sound effects on iphone: May need to change WAV format. - cashreg, foul (rubber ducky), click ok


Cosmetic
========

Fix scenery UVs

Round shadows for trees. Make shadows less dark

Show where finger is with a circle etc

"player 1" 3D text too far in.????
Spots/strips icon too

Wii and iphone: can't enter player name!!!
-> Could have GUI keyboard but maybe just have player 1, player 2 and no stats....?

iPhone: Controls page showing pictures of swipes/gestures

Positioning cue ball: put cue ball in closest legal position to cursor pos, rather than 'sticking' at last known good pos.

No lighting now!
Lighting is not the same as raw OpenGL, so some bits look too dark.
Phong shading + specular for balls

Some .leaf meshes had auto-gen UVs. The .objs have bogus UVs. Need to UV map them!

Marin height wrong (also Amju ?)

Timing wrong for take shot anim

Localisation
 - Don't use hard coded text on images
 - Use Localise for all text

Marin standing taking shot - bad last frame(s)

Bugs remaining from last release
================================

 - Amju skirt z fighting

 - Foul message wrong if cue ball potted (player name changes when next player becomes active ?)

 - 8 ball: no explanatory message if you lose by potting the 8-ball too soon
