Critical
========

iphone frame rate -- smaller ball meshes, smaller textures, no trees, etc.

Hearts flicker on Big Pockets screen, Trick shots 1 screen

Hearts count and status text at tope of screen overlap. + sometimes text is hard to read. Give text a BG ?

Cue pos (english, top spin, etc) uses picking and reads from back buffer!

Birds eye view - get rid of this except to place ball ? Or, you can't take a shot in b/eye mode

iphone: GUI for small screen

Sound - not playing sound FX

Cheri font: fix hearts and stars which are in lo res version

Remove edit player names option
Music option doesn't work! - just get rid of options

Efficiency
==========

release: make sure no _DEBUG, -O2, etc. 

iphone - strip dead code - set compiler flag

iphone bad framerate and music stutters -- too many polys ? Try non-debug


Pngs were upside-down. Either textures are being flipped somewhere or UVs (v coord) are being flipped ??
Flipped img, prob doing that twice for some (all) imgs ?!?
TODO Fix MD2 v-coord - md2 images are upside down but v-coord is flipped!?!?!?!!

Convert amju2 to amju2b ??
iphone reduced size textures

iphone + wii mipmapping ??? Also DX ?!


Audio
=====
Music plays on iphone but is choppy. If this can't be fixed, will have to not have music.

Check sound effects on iphone: May need to change WAV format. - cashreg, foul (rubber ducky), click ok


Cosmetic
========

"player 1" 3D text too far in.
Spots/strips icon too

iphone UI: buttons should be a lot bigger.

Wii/iphone buttons which don't make sense, e.g. change player name.
Options: full screen is not required. In fact could probably do without options menu at all.

Wii and iphone: can't enter player name!!!
-> Could have GUI keyboard but maybe just have player 1, player 2 and no stats....?

iPhone: Controls page showing pictures of swipes/gestures

Positioning cue ball: put cue ball in closest legal position to cursor pos, rather than 'sticking' at last known good pos.

No lighting now!
Lighting is not the same as raw OpenGL, so some bits look too dark.

Some .leaf meshses had auto-gen UVs. The .objs have bogus UVs. Need to UV map them!

Some meshes are supposed to be sphere-mapped.

Marin height wrong (also Amju ?)

Timing wrong for take shot anim

Localisation
 - Don't use hard coded text on images
 - Use Localise for all text


Bugs remaining from last release
================================

 - Amju skirt z fighting

 - Foul message wrong if cue ball potted (player name changes when next player becomes active ?)

 - 8 ball: no explanatory message if you lose by potting the 8-ball too soon
