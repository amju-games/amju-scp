Critical
========

iphone save data dir: currently is not saving

iphone load time - is using GlueFileMem :-( 
Depends which file type is taking the most time. E.g. maybe reducing png sizes would help

iphone frame rate -- smaller ball meshes, smaller textures, no trees, etc.


iphone: UI: Use only "left mouse button"
 --> detect 'flick' gesture, use this to control shot strength. So if y diff is a lot more than x diff, go to TakeShot mode.
EngineStatePoolSetUpShot.cpp:2990 - sets Take Shot mode on "L Mouse button" if y diff is high.
TODO Test on device, what should y diff value be ? (should this be x diff as screen is rotated?)
-- Can't aim shot but can take it!
Then make sure this is disabled for other platforms

Cue pos (english, top spin, etc) uses picking and reads from back buffer!
//Place ball
Birds eye view - get rid of this except to place ball ? Or, you can't take a shot in b/eye mode


Efficiency
==========


level0.amju2 (+ presumably the others) has multiple copies of sortscene! Is this as bad as it looks!?!?
-- No I think it's OK: each level file contains 4 "rooms"

release: make sure no _DEBUG, -O2, etc. 

iphone - strip dead code - set compiler flag

iphone bad framerate and music stutters -- too many polys ? Try non-debug


Pngs were upside-down. Either textures are being flipped somewhere or UVs (v coord) are being flipped ??
Flipped img, prob doing that twice for some (all) imgs ?!?
TODO Fix MD2 v-coord - md2 images are upside down but v-coord is flipped!?!?!?!!

Convert amju2 to amju2b ??
iphone reduced size textures

iphone + wii mipmapping ??? Also DX ?!


Audio
=====
Music plays on iphone but is choppy. If this can't be fixed, will have to not have music.

Check sound effects on iphone: May need to change WAV format. - cashreg, foul (rubber ducky), click ok


Cosmetic
========

hiscores.cfg message in loading screen

iphone: buttons don't respond properly. The first touch/release selects, then another is needed to click..!?!

iphone UI: buttons should be a lot bigger.

Wii/iphone buttons which don't make sense, e.g. change player name.
Options: full screen is not required. In fact could probably do without options menu at all.

Wii and iphone: can't enter player name!!!
-> Could have GUI keyboard but maybe just have player 1, player 2 and no stats....?

iPhone: Controls page showing pictures of swipes/gestures

Positioning cue ball: put cue ball in closest legal position to cursor pos, rather than 'sticking' at last known good pos.


Attract mode can get stuck on 'crazy' version with block in the way. This also causes other probs so delete this type of room.

No lighting now!
Lighting is not the same as raw OpenGL, so some bits look too dark.

Some .leaf meshses had auto-gen UVs. The .objs have bogus UVs. Need to UV map them!

Some meshes are supposed to be sphere-mapped.

Marin height wrong (also Amju ?)

Timing wrong for take shot anim

Localisation
 - Don't use hard coded text on images
 - Use Localise for all text


Bugs remaining from last release
================================

 - Amju skirt z fighting

 - Foul message wrong if cue ball potted (player name changes when next player becomes active ?)

 - 8 ball: no explanatory message if you lose by potting the 8-ball too soon
