BUGS ACROSS ALL PLATFORMS
=========================

Critical
========

UI with LMB only

Cue pos (english, top spin, etc) uses picking and reads from back buffer!
//Place ball
Birds eye view - get rid of this except to place ball ? Or, you can't take a shot in b/eye mode

Load time: load levels on demand

Efficiency
==========

release: make sure no _DEBUG, use -O2, etc. 

Pngs were upside-down. Either textures are being flipped somewhere or UVs (v coord) are being flipped ??
Flipped img, prob doing that twice for some (all) imgs ?!?
TODO Fix MD2 v-coord - md2 images are upside down but v-coord is flipped!?!?!?!!

Make sure VFC is in and working

Convert amju2 to amju2b  - check if doing this


Audio
=====


Cosmetic
========

Don't show heart score in top down/bird eye view

hiscores.cfg message in loading screen

Positioning cue ball: put cue ball in closest legal position to cursor pos, rather than 'sticking' at last known good pos.


No lighting now!
Lighting is not the same as raw OpenGL, so some bits look too dark.

Some .leaf meshses had auto-gen UVs. The .objs have bogus UVs. Need to UV map them!

Some meshes are supposed to be sphere-mapped.

Localisation
 - Don't use hard coded text on images
 - Use Localise for all text


Bugs remaining from last release
================================

 - Amju skirt z fighting

 - Foul message wrong if cue ball potted (player name changes when next player becomes active ?)

 - 8 ball: no explanatory message if you lose by potting the 8-ball too soon
